## Exploring-Weather-Trends
First project for my Data Analyst Nanodegree by Udacity. <br/>
<br/>
The main objective here is to analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends in the city I live to overall global temperature trends. <br/>
As a secondary goal, trends in temperature between Global, Berlin and the other Germany cities of Munich and Hamburg are parsed. <br/>
### Tools and sources
I use the SQL Workspace from Udacity to extract data from the temperatures database, then download the results to csv files. The data is analyzed using Excel spreadsheet. <br/>
<br/>
Three files have been provided by Udacity: <br/>
•	city_list - This contains a list of cities and countries in the database. Look through them in order to find the city nearest to me. <br/>
•	city_data - This contains the average temperatures for each city by year (ºC). <br/>
•	global_data - This contains the average global temperatures by year (ºC). <br/>  
<br/>
Calculations and graphs are made with Excel and results are presented in PDF. <br/>
